# This repo is my Scala playground.
I'm learning from Udemy's _Scala & Functional Programming Essentials | Rock the JVM_

#### The official repository for the Scala beginners course on Udemy
This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Scala beginners course](https://www.udemy.com/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners) on Udemy. Unless explicitly mentioned (_I'm adding my code to the courses' here_), the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.
